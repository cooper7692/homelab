All notable changes are documented here. Timestamps use EST in 24-hour format.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-05 17:45 EST
### Changed
- Normalized all timestamps to **EST 24-hour** across `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Synced `README.md` “Changelog” section to mirror this file (latest-first).
- Formalized versioning policy: **SemVer** (major=breaking, minor=features, patch=tweaks); every change increments version and adds an entry with timestamp.
